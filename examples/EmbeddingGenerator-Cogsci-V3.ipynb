    "# Generating Sentences with TreeRNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook goes through a minimal example of encoding one sentence into a distributed representation using a TreeRNN, and the using this distributed representation to generate another sentence using a different TreeRNN in reverse. To start, we'll do some data cleaning to make sure we have a good set of sentence pairs to train on. The main goal here is to remove sentences with mispelled words and oddities."
