    "# Generating Sentences with TreeRNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook goes through a minimal example of encoding one sentence into a distributed representation using a TreeRNN, and the using this distributed representation to generate another sentence using a different TreeRNN in reverse. To start, we'll do some data cleaning to make sure we have a good set of sentence pairs to train on. The main goal here is to remove sentences with mispelled words and oddities."

    "We can also generate entailment chains by re-encoding a generated sentence, and then generating new sentence from the subsequent encoding. This is kind of neat because it allows us to distill what the model has learned in a network of inferential relationships between sentences. Philosophers sometimes argue that the meaning of sentences is determined by it's role or location in such a network."
